Wrapper Online Diamond Got Hacked and Ransomware For Some Reason The All! And So, Wrapper Online Diamond Replaced WrapperTube For No Reason The All!

~~~ How to add to your wrapper. ~~~ 

1. Place this theme's folder into your asset reposity in resources/app/server/store/3a981f5cb2739137 (if you host asset server someplace else)
If you use wrapper offline 2.0.0 and 2.0.1, just place it in wrapper-offline-win32-x64/resources/app/server/store/3a981f5cb2739137
2. In themelist.xml, add [<theme id="Community_Library" name="Community Library" cc_theme_id="Community_Library"/>] to your xml file.
3. You should be good to go at this point, if there are any prolbems, let me know
